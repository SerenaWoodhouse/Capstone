The SUU school of Business ran a DEI survey at the end of their Spring 2021 semester and throughout this document I'll be using the data collected to make visualizations to help establish where the school of business stands with their students and faculty in matters of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. To make some of the visualizations easier to see I saved them into one power point document since I also used Tableau for a lot of the visualizations.

Start with the python notebook which explains the R code and then you can see the Tableau visualizations either throughout the workbook or in the powerpoint.
